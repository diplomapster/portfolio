Your webpage should include the following content:

A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub
pages sites or GitHub repositories.
For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
An “About Me” section.
Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
Your current interests/hobbies/skills.
Create a gh-pages branch so that your site can be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio (for example).
Don't forget your Git commits with an initial commit and a commit for every major code change, and include a README in your GitHub repository!
